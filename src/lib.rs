//! The [AXP209](http://dl.linux-sunxi.org/AXP/AXP209_Datasheet_v1.0en.pdf)
//! is a power management chip made by X-Powers for use mainly
//! in Allwinner ARM system-on-a-chip reference designs. It can be found
//! in quite a few systems, so if you've got a strange need to control
//! it from a supported Rust target, this'll get you there.
//! 
//! The machines I know of so far using it:
//! * [Next Thing Co.'s C.H.I.P computer](https://getchip.com/pages/chip)
//! * [Retro Games Ltd's C64 Mini](https://thec64.com/about/)
//! * [Cubietech's early Cubieboards (A10, A20, Cubietruck)](http://cubieboard.org/model/)
//!
//! The big challenge with interfacing with this chip is that because
//! it controls power, the kernel has exclusive access to it. That's
//! probably a good thing if you don't know what you're doing, and
//! if you brick your little computer, that's on you. ðŸ˜œ
//! 
//! This driver doesn't try to implement every feature yet and only supports
//! the following:
//! * Reading various channels of the ADC
//!   * Internal temperature
//!   * Battery level (0 - 100%)
//!   * Battery voltage, charging amperage, draining amperage
//!   * VBUS voltage, amperage (usually tied to USB input)
//!   * Power input voltage, amperage (additional external power)
//!   * TS input (for external temperatures or backup battery)
//!   * Voltage at GPIO 0 or 1
//! * Reading the power status
//!   * Is external power coming in?
//!   * Where's it coming from?
//!   * Is there a battery attached?
//!   * Is that battery (dis)charging?
//! * Using the internal 127 minute timer (see `timer_control`)
//! * Turning various output voltages on and off
//! 
//! Here's the output from the example program which runs on the PocketChip:
//! 
//! ```text
//! Battery level: 100%
//! Voltage: 4184mV
//! Discharge Current: 0mA
//! Charge Current:    0mA
//! ACIN Voltage:      0mV
//! ACIN Current:      0mA
//! Vbus Voltage:      0mV
//! Vbus Current:      0mA
//! Temperature:       47Â°C
//! Temp Sensor Pin:   0mV
//! Ipsout?!:          4583mV
//! 
//! ADC Control Flags: BATTERY_VOLTAGE | BATTERY_CURRENT | ACIN_VOLTAGE | ACIN_CURRENT | APS_VOLTAGE | TS | TEMPERATURE
//! Power Control Flags: LDO3 | DCDC2 | LDO4 | LDO2 | DCDC3 | EXTEN
//! Power Status Flags:  VBUS_PRESENT | VBUS_USABLE | VBUS_ABOVE_HOLD | START_ON_POWER
//! Charge Status Flags: BATTERY_PRESENT
//! 
//! Timer:
//! 	Expired: false
//! 	Time (minutes): 0
//! ```
//! 
//! If there's a feature you'd like to see implemented, either
//! [open an issue](https://github.com/RandomInsano/axp209-rs/issues)
//! or create a pull request if you're feeling helpful. Also feel free
//! to open an issue if you have general questions.
//! 
//! If you need some examples, check the `examples` folder. They won't work until
//! if you have a kernel that is accessing to the chip so expect some difficulty
//! there. Because I was using the chip on a single board computer, I had to
//! re-compile my kernel with every AXP20X feature disabled.
